Your Flask application now includes a route to handle executing Bash commands using the `subprocess` module. Here's an explanation of what you did:

1. You imported the required modules (`subprocess`, `os`) and your Flask app instance.
2. You defined a route at `/execute_bash` that will handle incoming requests. This route is decorated with `@app.route('/execute_bash')`.
3. When the client makes a request to this URL, your function will be executed. It retrieves the command from the request under the key 'command'.
4. You can now use the command as needed in your Flask application or other Python scripts.
