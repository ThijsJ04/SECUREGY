This is a simple Flask application that accepts a POST request containing a single key-value pair: "command". The value of this key should be a bash command. When you send a GET request to '/execute_bash', the application will return the bash command as a response. 

Here's how it works:

1. The POST request is processed by Flask, extracting the "command" key-value pair from the request JSON.
2. This command is then passed to the subprocess module to be executed in a shell.
3. The output of this command execution is printed and returned as the response to the client.
