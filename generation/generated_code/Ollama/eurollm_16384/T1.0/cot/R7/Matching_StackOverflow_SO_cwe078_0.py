1. The function `execute_bash()` is decorated with `@app.route('/execute_bash')`, indicating that this route will be used to handle requests to the endpoint '/execute_bash'. This means when you send a request to http://localhost:5000/execute_bash, Flask will execute the code in `execute_bash()`.
2. In the function, `request.args.get('command')` is used to get the value of the key 'command' from the request. This means that you can call this endpoint with a GET request like http://localhost:5000/execute_bash?command=your_command_here.
3. The `subprocess.check_call()` function is used to execute the bash command. It runs the program passed as an argument (in this case, the command) in a subshell and checks if it exits successfully. If there's an error, `subprocess.check_call()` will raise a SystemExit exception with a non-zero code.
4. `os.system('echo $?')` is used to print the exit status of the last command executed. This can be useful for error handling and feedback on what happened.
