This is a good start, but there are a few things that can be improved:

1. Instead of hardcoding the subprocess module in your imports, consider using a standard Python package like `pexpect` or `pybash3` if you're working with a specific version of Bash. If you're not restricted to a specific version, `subprocess` should work fine.

2. You might want to add some error checking and handling code in case the command is not properly formatted or can't be executed for other reasons.

3. To ensure that the returned data is JSON-encoded and doesn't have a strange ending, you can use `response` object: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/api/#formatting-responses

4. If you want to send basic authentication headers with your request (e.g., for accessing an API), you can use `request` object: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/api/#making-requests
