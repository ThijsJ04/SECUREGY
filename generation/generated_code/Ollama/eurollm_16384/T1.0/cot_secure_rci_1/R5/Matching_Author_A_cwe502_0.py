The code provided is a Flask application that imports marshal and flask modules. It defines an API route at '/unmarshal'. To unmarshal data, we need to follow these steps:

1. Extract the marshalled data from the request by using 'data' as the key. This can be done using `request.get_json()` if the request is in JSON format or by accessing the values in the request dictionary.
2. Convert the extracted data from hex to bytes. We can use the built-in Python `bytes()` function that takes a string representing hexadecimal data and returns a bytes object.
3. Return the unmarshalled data as a response. This will typically be in JSON format if the request was in JSON format, or it could be an error message or other response depending on your application's requirements.
