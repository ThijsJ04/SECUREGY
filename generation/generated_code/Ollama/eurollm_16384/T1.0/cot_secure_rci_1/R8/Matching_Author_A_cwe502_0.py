To answer this question, let's break down the solution step-by-step.

First, we have an HTML form that accepts user input. This is not directly relevant to our task of understanding how 'data' will be unmarshalled in Flask. 

Next, we import 'marshal', which seems out of place here as marshal is a Python module and should be used within the code. If this were part of a larger application, it would likely belong elsewhere.

Then, from 'flask' we import 'Flask', 'request'. Flask is used for creating web servers, request allows us to interact with HTTP requests/responses. This suggests that our code might be part of an API or web application handling incoming HTTP requests.

We also have an app = Flask(__name__). This creates a new instance of the Flask class, initializing it based on the name of the current module.

Then we define @app.route('/unmarshal') which tells Flask that any request to '/unmarshal' should be handled by our function named 'unmarshal_data'. 

Finally, within unmarshal_data() function, it uses request.get_json(silent=True) to get data from the POST request and unpickle(request.get_data('data')). Here request.get_json(silent=True) parses JSON data from our request into Python's native datatypes. This is then used as the 'data'.
unpickle converts the pickled data from bytes to a Python object.
