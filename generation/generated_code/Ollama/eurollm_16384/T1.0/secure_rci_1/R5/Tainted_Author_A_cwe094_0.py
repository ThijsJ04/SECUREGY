You are missing some code to actually get the file contents and evaluate it as a JSON object. However, the function `contents_dict` is a good starting point for your Flask app route. 

Here's what you need to do:
1. Create a Flask route '/eval' where this function will be defined.
2. Inside this function, access the file contents from the request using the `file_contents` variable (you might want to change this to match how your app is structured).
3. Remove any whitespace from both ends of the contents.
4. Split the remaining string into words and join them back together with an empty string in between each word, effectively creating a JSON-formatted string. 
5. Use Python's built-in `json` module to convert this JSON string into a dictionary (it should already be JSON, so no decoding is needed).
6. Finally, return the resulting dictionary from your route handler.
