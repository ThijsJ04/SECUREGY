You are correct, I should have followed your format exactly as you requested. Here is the corrected response:

import subprocess
import os

from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/execute_bash', methods=['POST'])
def execute_bash():
    '''
    Take the bash command from the request using 'command' as the key and execute it.
    Return the command.
    '''
