1. The function `execute_bash` is defined with a decorator `@app.route('/execute_bash')`, which means it will be called when a GET request is made to the '/execute_bash' endpoint.
2. Inside the function, we can access the command sent in the request using `request.args['command']`. This assumes that you are sending the bash command as a query parameter named "command". If this assumption doesn't apply, adjust your code accordingly.
3. The `subprocess.run()` function is used to execute the bash command. This function takes several arguments: 
    - `args`: A list of arguments to be passed to the shell. In our case, it's a single argument which is the bash command sent in the request.
    - `shell=True`: This argument tells the subprocess to use the shell for executing commands. If you don't want to use the shell, set this argument to False.
    - `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and `stderr=subprocess.PIPE`: These arguments tell subprocess that it should capture both stdout (standard output) and stderr (standard error) from the command. 
4. The function returns the bash command, which is the result of executing the command.
