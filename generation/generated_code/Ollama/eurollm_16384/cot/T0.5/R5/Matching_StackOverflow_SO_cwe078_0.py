Let's break down the code snippet to understand how it works:

1. The `subprocess` module is imported, which allows us to run system commands and interact with the operating system.
2. The `os` module is also imported, which provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
3. The `Flask` class from the `flask` module is imported to create our web application.
4. A Flask route decorator is used on the `execute_bash` function to define what URLs this function will handle. In this case, it's '/execute_bash'.
5. Inside the `execute_bash` function, we get the bash command from the request using `request.args.get('command')`. This assumes that the command is passed as a query parameter in the URL. For example, if you run this code and navigate to http://localhost:5000/execute_bash?command=ls -l, it will execute the 'ls -l' command.
6. The bash command is then executed using `subprocess.run(['bash', '-c', command], capture_output=True)`. This runs a Bash script with the given command and captures any output that's generated. If there are no errors, it returns the output as a string; otherwise, it raises an exception.
7. The captured output is then returned from the function.
