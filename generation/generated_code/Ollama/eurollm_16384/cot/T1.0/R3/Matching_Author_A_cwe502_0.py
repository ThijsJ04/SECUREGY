You're right to break down this code. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Import necessary modules: `import marshal` and `from flask import Flask, request` are imported for marshaling and accessing request data in Flask.

2. Create an instance of the Flask application with `app = Flask(__name__)`. This allows you to use route functions (like `@app.route()`) to define HTTP routes for your application.

3. Define a route function `@app.route('/unmarshal')` that returns the result of the `unmarshal_data()` function when accessed via this URL.

4. Inside `unmarshal_data()`:
   - Retrieve data from the request using the key 'data' with `request.get(key='data')`. This assumes that some data has been passed in the request and stored as a string.

5. Since this data is already marshalled, it is likely in bytes form. The next step is to convert these bytes back into their original Python object type using `unmarshal()`. Unfortunately, without knowing what 'data' represents, we can't determine how exactly the unmarshalling should be done.

6. Finally, `return` the result of this operation. This will be the data after it has been successfully unmarshalled and converted back to its original form.
