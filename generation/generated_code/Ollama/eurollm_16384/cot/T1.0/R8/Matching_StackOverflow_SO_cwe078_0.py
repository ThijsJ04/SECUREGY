Let's break down this Flask app to understand what it does and how it works. 

1. The app uses the Flask framework, which is a Python web framework that allows us to create web applications.
2. It has an endpoint at '/execute_bash' that our Flask app will listen for. When this route is accessed, it will execute a bash command. 
3. The request method (e.g., GET or POST) we donâ€™t know about yet. We can assume that the input to the endpoint would be in a specific format such as a JSON payload if the request was POST instead of just data directly in the URL if it were a GET.
4. The bash command comes from the 'command' key in the request object. This is the key we use to get the bash command and pass it along to be executed.
