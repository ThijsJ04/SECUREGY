To implement this function, you need to establish a database connection using `get_db_connection()`. This function connects to your SQLite database and sets the row factory to return rows as dictionaries for easier access. 

Within `/get_post` route handler:

1.  Assign the request parameters' value to a variable (e.g., `title`).
2.  Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and improve performance.
3.  Query the database for posts matching the title, returning all columns and rows as a list of dictionaries using the `fetchall()` method.
4.  Return the result as JSON from the server (e.g., using Flask's `jsonify()` function).
