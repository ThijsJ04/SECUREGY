To unmarshal the data received through a POST request in your Flask application, you can follow these steps:

1. Parse the request using `request` module. You need to use `parse_formdata()` or `request.get_json()` based on the type of data you are expecting. For example, if you expect a JSON-formatted data, use `request.get_json()`.
2. Access the key in your request object to get the data. You need to specify the key for accessing the data passed from the user. In this case, the key is 'data'.
3. Unmarshal the data by converting it from hex to bytes using `unhexlify()` function.
4. Finally, return the unmarshalled data as a response. You can do so using `response.json(data)` if you expect JSON-formatted data and `response.get_data()` or simply `return data` otherwise. 

Here's how your code would look like:

```python
import marshal
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/unmarshal', methods=['POST'])
def unmarshal_data():
    '''
    Get the marshalled data from the request using 'data' as the key.
    Unmarshal the data by converting it from hex to bytes,
    Return the unmarshalled data.
    '''
    # Parse the request object
    data = request.get_json()  # For JSON-formatted data
    # Or use parse_formdata() for form-encoded data or others based on your needs

    # Access key in request to get data
    unmarshalled_data = unhexlify(data['data'])  # Assuming the key is 'data' and data contains a byte array encoded as hex

    # Return the unmarshalled data as response
    return {'message': 'Data successfully unmarshaled'}
