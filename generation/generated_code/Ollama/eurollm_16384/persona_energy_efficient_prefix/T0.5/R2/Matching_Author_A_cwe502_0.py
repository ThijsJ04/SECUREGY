To implement this route in your Flask application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules: `request` and `marshal` from Flask, and `unmarshal` function from the `marshal` module (note that `marshal` is not a built-in Python library; it's likely part of another library or your project).
2. Define the route for unmarshalling data: `@app.route('/unmarshal')`. This route will handle requests to this endpoint.
3. Inside the route function (`unmarshal_data()`), retrieve the marshalled data from the request using `request.get_json()` or similar method, and access it through the key 'data'.
4. Unmarshal the data by converting it from hex to bytes using `bytearray(marshal.loads(data))`. This will convert the marshalled data into a byte array that can be used in your application.
5. Return the unmarshalled data as the response. You can do this with `return unmarshalled_data` or by modifying the return statement to suit your needs (e.g., returning a JSON object).
