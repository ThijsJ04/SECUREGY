The problem statement is incomplete and doesn't include the actual code for unmarshaling the data. However, I can provide a general approach to solving this problem assuming we have marshaled data in the request using 'data' as the key. 

To unmarshal the data, you would need to:

1. Get the marshalled data from the request using 'data' as the key.
2. Convert the marshalled data from hexadecimal to bytes (e.g., using the `unhexlify` function from Python's built-in `struct` module).
3. Unmarshal the byte data into a native Python object (e.g., using the `loads` method from Python's `json` module for JSON data or a custom unmarshaling function for a specific type of data).
4. Return the unmarshalled data as the response to the request. 

However, without the actual marshaled data and its expected format, it is difficult to provide more specific code. If you can provide more context or the marshalled data itself, I'd be happy to help with a detailed solution.
