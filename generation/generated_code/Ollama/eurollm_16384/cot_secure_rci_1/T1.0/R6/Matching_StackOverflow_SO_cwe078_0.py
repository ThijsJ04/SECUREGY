To understand how to modify the given code snippet, let's break down the requirements:

1. The function `execute_bash` takes a request with the key 'command'. 
2. It should execute the bash command provided as the value of that key using subprocess module and return it.
3. We are using Flask, so we will need to include import statements for the necessary modules (Flask, request, and subprocess) in our code.
4. The subprocess library allows us to spawn external processes and interact with them using pipes or files. It provides a function called `run()` that can be used to execute bash commands. However, we should use `check_output()` from subprocess instead of `run()` as it returns bytes which are easier to work with in Python.
5. The check_output() function executes the command in a new process and returns its stdout. If any error occurs, None is returned instead. So, we should handle that case using try-except block to avoid a ZeroDivisionError later on.
