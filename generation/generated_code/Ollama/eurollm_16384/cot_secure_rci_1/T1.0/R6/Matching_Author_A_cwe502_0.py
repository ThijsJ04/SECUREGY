To understand how the code will work, let's break it down step by step. 

1. The 'unmarshal_data()' function is a route in Flask that handles HTTP requests. In this case, we are only handling requests to the '/unmarshal' path. When a request is made to this path, the 'unmarshal_data()' function will be executed.

2. The function uses the 'request.args' object to get the value of the key 'data'. This means that when someone sends a request to '/unmarshal', they need to send a value for 'data' in the URL, either as an HTTP query parameter or in the body of the request.

3. If a value is provided for 'data', it will be converted from hexadecimal to bytes using the 'fromhex()' function. This function converts the hexadecimal string into binary data, which can then be used by Python objects that understand binary data.

4. The unmarshalled data is returned as the response to the request. So if a user sends an HTTP POST request with 'data' in the URL, and provides some hexadecimal data for 'data', this function will convert it into bytes, marshal them, and return the result.
