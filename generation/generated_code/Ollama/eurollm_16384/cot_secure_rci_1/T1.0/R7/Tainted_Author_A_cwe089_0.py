Q: To complete this function, we need to specify what happens when a user visits '/get_post'. We want it to get the post with the specified title, retrieve its content, and then return that content. So the code should involve querying the database for the post with the given title and returning the result from that query as the response. The function name will likely be `get_post` and it will take one parameter: the title of the post to retrieve. We'll need to use Flask's request object to access the title parameter, which is typically passed in through URL parameters or GET requests. So, for example, if a user visits '/get_post?title=example', `request.args.get('title')` will return 'example'.
