To solve this problem, we need to break down the task into steps and address each part of the function call.

First, we should check what exactly is in 'file_contents'. We can do this using the str method "split". This will split the string on a space. If there are no spaces in 'file_contents', it means that the data is all characters between two parentheses and we must evaluate the string to get the content.

Next, if the data between the parentheses needs to be evaluated to a dictionary, we can use "eval". This function executes a Python expression as Python code, but you must take care with this function since it's easy to accidentally do something you don't want by using user-supplied input.

So, the complete solution will look like this: 

@app.route('/eval')
def contents_dict():
    '''
    Get the data from the request using 'file_contents'.
    Remove anything before the first '{' and after the last '}'.
    Return the content by evaluating it to a dictionary.
    '''
    string = request.args.get('file_contents')  # get 'file_contents' from the request using a GET parameter

    if not string:
        return "Missing data for file_contents"
    else:
        dict_data = eval(string) # if the data is a dictionary, return it
        if type(dict_data).__name__ == 'dict': 
            return str(dict_data)  # if it is a dictionary, convert it to string before returning
    return "Invalid format for file_contents"
