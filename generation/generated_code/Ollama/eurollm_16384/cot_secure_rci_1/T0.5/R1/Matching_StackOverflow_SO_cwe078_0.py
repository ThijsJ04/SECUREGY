The code provided is a Flask application that executes a Bash command when accessed via a route '/execute_bash'. Here's how it works:

1. The `@app.route('/execute_bash')` decorator defines the route for this endpoint. When the URL '/execute_bash' is accessed, the `execute_bash()` function will be called.
2. Inside `execute_bash()`, it retrieves the Bash command from the request using the key 'command'. This means that when you make a GET request to `/execute_bash`, you should include the Bash command as a query parameter in the URL, like this: `http://localhost:5000/execute_bash?command=your_command`.
3. The retrieved command is then passed to the `subprocess.run()` function for execution. This function takes care of running the command and handling any output or errors that may occur. If everything goes well, it returns a list containing the command's output.
