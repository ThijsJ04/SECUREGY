You've already started working on a Flask application to handle user registration and login functionality using SQLite as the database. I will now complete your code with the missing parts to make it fully functional for handling user authentication:

1. Create an endpoint to retrieve user information by username.
2. Create a route to log in the user and generate a session cookie.
3. Create routes to update user information (e.g., email) and delete users.
4. Create a protected endpoint for authenticated users to access specific functionality.
