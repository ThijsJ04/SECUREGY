This Flask application defines a single route, `/execute_bash`, which executes a Bash command provided via the request. The `subprocess` module is used to execute the command, while the `os` module provides the necessary information about the current process's working directory. This example uses a Flask application for demonstration purposes; in a real-world scenario, you would likely integrate this functionality into an existing workflow or service.

Example use cases:

* Running a Bash script
* Executing system commands with environment variables
* Calling external programs from your application
