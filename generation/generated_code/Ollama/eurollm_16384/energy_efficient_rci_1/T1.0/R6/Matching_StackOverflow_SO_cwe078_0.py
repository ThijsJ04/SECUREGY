This code defines a Flask app with a single route ("/execute_bash") that takes a bash command from the request, executes it, and returns the command itself. Here’s how you can understand this code:

1. The `subprocess` module is imported for invoking shell commands in Python. This module allows us to spawn new shell sessions, connect to running processes or to create a subshell to execute a specified command and handle the results.

2. The `os` module is also imported to use operating system dependent functionality. For instance, to check if an environment variable exists or not.

3. The `Flask` class from the flask package is used to create a new web application instance. This Flask app will be able to respond to HTTP requests.

4. A route named "/execute_bash" is defined using the `@app.route()` decorator, which is provided by Flask to expose the functionality of a function (the decorated function) as an endpoint of our web application. The string `'command'` after a colon in the decorator indicates that we’re expecting key-value pairs to be posted via HTTP request. In this case, the key for bash commands will be 'command'.

5. The `execute_bash()` function is responsible for executing the received bash command and returning it. Here's how it works:
    - It first constructs the bash command using the command from request.get('command'). This gets the value posted in the 'command' key as a string.
    - Then it executes this command via `subprocess.check_output()` which is a built-in method that will run a system shell command and return its output as bytes. To convert this to a human-readable string, we use the `str.decode('utf-8')` method.
    - Finally, it returns this converted command as the response from our API.
