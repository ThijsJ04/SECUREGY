This is a basic Flask application that allows users to send a request with a bash command, which will then be executed on the server. The `execute_bash` function takes the bash command from the request using 'command' as the key and executes it. It returns the command. Note that this is a simple example and does not include any error handling or security measures. In a real application, you would want to add checks for potential security risks and validate user input.
