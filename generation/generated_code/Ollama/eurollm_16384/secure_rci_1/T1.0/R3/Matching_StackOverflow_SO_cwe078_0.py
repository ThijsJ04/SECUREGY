This Flask application defines a route `/execute_bash` that accepts a request with a key-value pair `command` in its query string. The value of `command` is treated as a bash command, which is then executed using the `subprocess` module and returned as the response.

**Important Notes:**

* This application assumes that the subprocess module can execute bash commands on your system. If this is not the case (e.g., if you're running Flask in a non-Linux environment), you may need to modify the code accordingly.
* This application does not handle any errors or exceptions that might occur when executing the bash command. You should add error handling code to suit your specific needs.
* Be cautious when exposing this route on a publicly accessible server, as it can execute arbitrary commands. Only use this route with carefully vetted input and in controlled environments.
