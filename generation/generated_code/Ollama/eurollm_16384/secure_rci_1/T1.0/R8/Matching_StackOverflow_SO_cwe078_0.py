You're on the right track with your Flask app and subprocess import for executing a Bash command. However, there are some additional steps you need to take to make this work securely:
```python
from flask import request, Response
import os
import subprocess  # You already imported it!
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads'  # Set the Upload folder
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'pdf', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png'}  # Define allowed file types
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024  # Limit content length for file uploads
strip_accents = lambda x: x.encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode("utf-8")
secure_filename = strip_accents(os.path.basename)
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and \
           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@app.route('/execute_bash')
def execute_bash():
    command = request.form['command']  # Fetch the command from POST request
    if 'filename' in request.files:  # Check if a file was uploaded
        file = request.files['filename']
        if file and allowed_file(secure_filename):
            filename = secure_filename
            print("Executing command")
            result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True)  # Execute the Bash command with 'shell=True' for shebang support
            return Response(content=result.decode('utf-8'), status=0, mimetype='text/plain')
        else:
            return "Invalid file", 415
    elif 'command' in request.form:  # If no file was uploaded, assume command is in POST data
        print("Executing command")
        result = subprocess.check_output(command + ' &> /dev/null', shell=True) # Don't use shell=True for your final executable version
        return Response(content=result.decode('utf-8'), status=0, mimetype='text/plain')
    else:
        return "Invalid request", 400
