This code snippet is a Flask application that listens for HTTP requests on a specific route ('/execute_bash') and executes a Bash command based on the command provided in the request. Here's how it works:

1. The `@app.route('/execute_bash')` decorator is used to define a route for the Flask application. This route will be the endpoint where requests are made to execute Bash commands.
2. Inside the `execute_bash()` function, it uses the `request.args` dictionary to access the command parameter from the request. The key used is 'command'.
3. It then executes the provided command using the `subprocess.run()` method and returns the command as a string. This means that if you make a GET request to `http://localhost:5000/execute_bash?command=ls -l`, it will execute the 'ls -l' command in Bash and return the output.
4. If an exception occurs during the execution of the command, the error message is returned instead of the command. This ensures that any errors encountered are properly handled and displayed to the user.
