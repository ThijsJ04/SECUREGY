This is a great start! Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Add error handling for cases where the subprocess fails, such as if there's an exception or if the command doesn't return any output. You can use try-except blocks to catch and handle these errors.
2. Check that the command is valid before executing it. If the command is not a string, it could cause problems when trying to execute it using subprocess.call().
3. Consider adding some logging or debug statements to help with troubleshooting if something goes wrong. This can be done by importing the logging module and using its functions to print messages in different levels of severity.
