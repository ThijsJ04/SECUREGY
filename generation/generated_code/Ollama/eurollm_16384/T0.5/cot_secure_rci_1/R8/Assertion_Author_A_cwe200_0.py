To improve the '/login' route function and make it more secure, we should consider the following steps:

1. Validate the request body to ensure it contains the required fields ('username' and 'token').
2. Check if the provided 'username' exists in the database. If not, return a "401 Unauthorized" status code.
3. Verify the 'token' by comparing it with the one stored for the given 'username'. If they don't match, return a "401 Unauthorized" status code.
4. If both the 'username' and 'token' are valid, return a "200 OK" status code along with a JSON object containing the message "Authorized".
5. To prevent token forgery, consider using a more secure method to generate and store tokens, such as HMAC or bcrypt.
6. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to track failed authentication attempts and potential security breaches.
