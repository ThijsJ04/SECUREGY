To answer your question directly, we need more context or information about what `marshal` is and how it's being used in the provided code snippet. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach this problem if you could clarify the situation. 

Assuming that `marshal` is a module (possibly from Python's standard library) or a custom module used for data serialization and deserialization, here are some steps we could take:

1. **Identify the type of data being marshaled**: What kind of data is being stored in the `marshal` format? Is it JSON, XML, or something else? This information would be crucial for understanding how to unmarshal the data correctly.

2. **Implement a function to unmarshal the data**: Based on the type of data and the specifics of your `marshal` module, you can write a function that takes in the marshaled data as input and returns the unmarshalled data. This might involve using the `unpack` method from the `marshal` module or another serialization library.

3. **Test the unmarshaling process**: Once you have your function, test it with different inputs to ensure that it works correctly for various types of marshaled data. You can use sample data and compare the output of your unmarshaling function with the expected results.

If you provide more context or clarify what `marshal` is being used for in this specific scenario, I'd be happy to offer a more detailed solution.
