First, we need to establish a connection to our SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`. We specify the path to our database file as './Database/database.db'. The `row_factory=sqlite3.Row` argument is used to return rows from the cursor as dictionaries, which makes it easier to access column values by name.

Next, we define a Flask route using `@app.route('/get_post')` which will handle HTTP GET requests to this endpoint. The function associated with this route is called `get_account()`. This function is where we'll retrieve the post content based on the provided title.

The actual implementation of the `get_account()` function is not shown in your code snippet, but it should involve querying our database for a post with a specific title and returning its content.
