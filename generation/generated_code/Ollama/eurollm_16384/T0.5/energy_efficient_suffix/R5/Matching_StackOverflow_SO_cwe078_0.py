Your code seems mostly correct, but there are a few things to consider for security and robustness:

1. Handling errors: Make sure you handle any potential errors that might occur when executing the bash command. You can use try/except blocks to catch exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
2. Validating input: Before executing the bash command, validate the input to ensure it is a string containing only whitespace-separated words (i.e., no special characters). This will help prevent malicious code from being executed.
3. Logging output: It would be helpful to log the output of the bash command for debugging purposes. You can use Python's built-in `logging` module for this.
4. Redirecting output: Instead of echoing the output directly back to the client, consider redirecting it to a file or another logging mechanism. This will help keep your application's response clean and prevent unnecessary data from being sent over the network.
