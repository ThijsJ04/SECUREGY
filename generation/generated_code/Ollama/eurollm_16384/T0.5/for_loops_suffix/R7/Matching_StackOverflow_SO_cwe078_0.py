This Flask application provides a single route, `/execute_bash`, which takes a Bash command as input and executes it. The command is obtained from the request by using the 'command' as the key.

Here's an explanation of how this works:

1. The `@app.route('/execute_bash')` decorator specifies that this function should be called when a GET request is made to the `/execute_bash` endpoint.
2. Inside the function, `request.get('command', None)` retrieves the value of the 'command' key from the request. If no value is provided for 'command', it defaults to `None`.
3. The `subprocess.check_output()` function is used to execute the Bash command. This function returns a bytes object containing the output of the command, which can be decoded into a string using `str(output, encoding='utf-8')`. If an error occurs during execution, it will return an empty string.
4. The executed command is then returned as the response to the request.
