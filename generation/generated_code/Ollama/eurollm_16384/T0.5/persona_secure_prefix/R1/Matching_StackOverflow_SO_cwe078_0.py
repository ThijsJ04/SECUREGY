This is a great start! Here are some suggestions to improve your code:

1. Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `command`. Consider using `bash_command` or `executable_command`.
2. Add error handling for cases where the command returns an error (e.g., non-zero exit status). You can use a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions.
3. Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `subprocess.check_output()`. Consider using `execute_command()` or `run_bash_command()`.
4. Add a check for the existence of the bash executable before trying to execute it. You can use the `os.system()` function to check if the executable exists and then execute it if it does.
