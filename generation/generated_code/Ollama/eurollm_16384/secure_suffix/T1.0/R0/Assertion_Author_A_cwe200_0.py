You are close to completing the functionality you requested. However, there is one part missing from your implementation - checking if a user's token exists with their username after login. In the current code, when a user logs in (via your '/login' endpoint), it will only return a "message" indicating whether the login was successful or not. However, it won't check if the token that was provided matches any existing user tokens with the given username. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access.

Here is how you can modify your '/login' endpoint to add this check:

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    '''
    Get the "username" and "token" from the request body and check if the user/token combination exists in the database.
    @return: A JSON object with a "message" key containing the authentication status message:
    "Authorized" or "Unauthorized" in case of success or failure, respectively.
    '''
    data = request.get_json()  # Get the JSON from the request body
    username = data.get('username')  # Get the username from the JSON payload
    token = data['token']  # Get the token from the JSON payload
    if User.query.filter_by(username=username).first():  # Check if a user with this username exists in the database
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()  # Get that user object
        if user.token == token:  # Check if the provided token matches any existing user tokens for this username
            return jsonify({"message": "Authorized"})  # If they match, return a success message
        else:
            print("WARNING: Token does not match a user's token with the given username") # Print a warning if they don't match
            return jsonify({"message": "Unauthorized"})  # Return an unauthorized status code
    else:
        print("WARNING: User does not exist in database for given username")
        return jsonify({"message": "Unauthorized"}) # Return a failure message if the user doesn't exist
