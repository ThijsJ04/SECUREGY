This code defines a Flask route ('/unmarshal') that accepts JSON or pickled data in its request body. It extracts the marshalled data using the 'data' key and then converts it from hex to bytes, which is the typical way marshaled data is represented in Python. Finally, it returns the unmarshalled data as the response. 

Here are a few things you should know:
- Flask is the web framework used for this application.
- The '/unmarshal' route is defined with @app.route('/unmarshal') decorator. This decorator is used to associate the given URL endpoint with a specific function.
- The request object represents the HTTP request that the Flask server receives. In this case, we can get the marshalled data from the 'data' key of the request object.
- marshal is Pythonâ€™s serialization library for converting an object into a stream of bytes. It's used to marshal and unmarshal Python objects. However, it's not part of standard Python distribution. You need to install marshmallow library if you want to use marshalled data with Flask.
- The 'data' key is used to get the marshalled data from the request object. 
- The data obtained from 'data' key should be in bytes form, as per marshalled data convention.
- Finally, we return the unmarshalled data as the response of our route function.
